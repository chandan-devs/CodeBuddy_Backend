Sure! Here's a concise to-do list:

### **To-Do List for User Authentication and Database Design**

#### **1. Database Design:**
- [ ] Create `Users` table with the following columns:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `username`
  - `email`
  - `password`
  - `role`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

#### **2. Backend Setup:**
- [✅] Initialize a new project (e.g., NEST.JS).
- Workbench setting 
- [✅] Configure the database connection.
    - mysql workbench ✅ 
        - add details for connection ✅
- 
- [ ] CRATE TABLE AND CHECK CONNECTION BY MAKING QUERY 
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (JWT, bcrypt, Express, database client).
-

#### **3. User Registration:**
- [ ] Create endpoint for user registration.
- [ ] Hash passwords before storing them in the database.

#### **4. User Login:**
- [ ] Create endpoint for user login.
- [ ] Verify hashed passwords and generate JWT tokens.

#### **5. JWT Middleware:**
- [ ] Create middleware to verify JWT tokens and attach user info to requests.

#### **6. Role-Based Access Control:**
- [ ] Implement middleware to check user roles and restrict access to routes based on roles.

#### **7. Testing and Deployment:**
- [ ] Test registration and login functionalities.
- [ ] Verify JWT token generation and validation.
- [ ] Test role-based access control.
- [ ] Deploy backend and database to a cloud provider.
- [ ] Document API endpoints and authentication processes.

This should provide a clear path for implementing your user authentication system and database design.
